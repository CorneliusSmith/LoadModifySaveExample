# LoadModifySaveExample
Modification of LoadModifySave example in app4mc for GSoC.

This example uses org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, so if it's not already there the jar should be added to the buildpath which can be found here: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi


The full workspace can be seen in the workspace foolder, or just the modified java file can be found by itself.
